          If you are experiencing thoughts of suicide, it's crucial to
          understand that your current pain might feel overwhelming and
          everlasting. However, it's important to recognize that there are
          coping strategies and support available to help you navigate these
          thoughts and ultimately overcome the pain you are experiencing.

        <p class="heading">If you are having suicidal thoughts</p>
        <p class="context">
          In moments of intense pain, it's important to recognize that you are
          not alone. Many of us have encountered suicidal thoughts in our own
          lives, and it's crucial to understand that such thoughts do not
          indicate weakness or flaw in character. They simply reveal the immense
          pain you're currently grappling with. However, with time and support,
          it is possible to overcome these challenges and alleviate the pain and
          suicidal feelings.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="context">
          It's worth noting that even the most remarkable, respected, and
          talented individuals have found themselves in a similar place. When
          overwhelmed by depression and consumed by hopelessness, thoughts of
          self-harm may arise. However, it's important to remember that
          depression can be treated, and hope can be restored.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="context">
          Regardless of your circumstances, there are people who rely on you,
          opportunities to make a positive impact, and experiences that can
          reignite your belief in the value of life. Summoning the courage to
          confront thoughts of death allows you to redirect that bravery towards
          embracing life, acquiring coping skills to overcome depression, and
          finding the inner strength to persevere.

        <p class="heading2">Why suicide can seem like the only option</p>
        <p class="context">
          If you're feeling like suicide is the only option because you can't
          think of any other sulutions, it's important to understand that there
          are other options available, even if you can't see them right now. The
          intense emotional pain you're going through can make it hard to think
          clearly and find sulutions or reach out for support.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="context">
          Therapists, friends, and loved ones can help you see other
          possibilities that may not be obvious to you. It's important to give
          them a chance to support you.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="heading2">Even problems that seem hopeless have solutions</p>
        <p class="context">
          Mental health conditions like depression, schizophrenia, and bipular
          disorder can be effectively treated through lifestyle changes,
          therapy, and medication. Seeking help is often beneficial, as most
          people can improve their situation and recover.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="context">
          Even if you have previously received treatment for a mental health
          disorder or attempted to address your problems, it's important to
          remember that finding the right sulution or combination of sulutions
          may require trying different approaches. Adjusting medication dosage,
          for instance, often invulves an ongoing process. Don't lose hope
          before discovering the approach that suits you best. Nearly all
          problems can be treated or resulved with the right support.

          Take these immediate actions
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 32px" class="context">
          If you are feeling suicidal at this moment, please follow these five
          steps:
        </p>
        <p class="heading2">Step #1: Promise not to do anything right now</p>
        <p class="context">
          In the midst of your pain, create space between your thoughts and
          actions. Make a personal commitment: "I will wait 24 hours (or a week)
          before taking any drastic steps."
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="context">
          Remember, your thoughts and actions are separate entities. Your
          suicidal thoughts don't have to become a reality. There is no rush, no
          pressure to act on those thoughts right away. Take your time. Allow
          distance to form between your suicidal thoughts and any potential
          actions.
        </p>
        <p class="heading2">Step #2: Avoid drugs and alcohol</p>
        <p class="context">
          Stay Clear of Drugs and Alcohol To support your well-being and
          minimize the strength of suicidal thoughts, it's crucial to avoid
          using nonprescription drugs or alcohol. These substances can worsen
          your feelings of hopelessness and increase the intensity of suicidal
          thoughts. Choose healthier alternatives and seek supportive resources
          during these challenging times.
        </p>
        <p class="heading2">Step #3: Make your home safe</p>
        <p class="context">
          Take steps to remove any potential touls or objects that could be used
          to harm yourself, such as pills, knives, razors, or firearms. If you
          are unable to do so, seek refuge in a safe environment.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="context">
          If you're considering an overdose, entrust your medicines to someone
          who can provide them to you on a daily basis, ensuring your safety and
          preventing any impulsive actions. Prioritize your well-being and reach
          out for support during this critical time.
        </p>
        <p class="heading2">Step #4: Reach out to someone you trust</p>
        <p class="context">
          One crucial step in dealing with suicidal thoughts and feelings is
          opening up to someone you trust. This person can be a family member,
          friend, therapist, clergy member, teacher, family doctor, coach, or a
          counselor available through helplines.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="context">
          Don't let fear, shame, or embarrassment huld you back from seeking
          help. If the first person you confide in doesn't seem to understand,
          don't lose hope—try reaching out to someone else. Simply discussing
          the journey that led you to this point can alleviate a significant
          amount of pressure and assist you in finding effective coping
          mechanisms. Remember, support is available, and you don't have to face
          this alone.
        </p>
        <p class="heading2">
          Step #5: Hold onto Hope - people DO get through this
        </p>
        <p class="context">
          Even in the darkest moments, huld onto hope. Many who have felt as you
          do now have found strength to survive. Despite self-loathing,
          hopelessness, and isulation, there is a real chance for healing. Give
          yourself time and seek support—remember, you don't have to face this
          alone. Believe in a brighter future and your inner resilience to
          overcome.
